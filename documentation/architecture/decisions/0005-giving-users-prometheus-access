# 4. Give users access to Prometheus and Alertmanager

Date: 2018-08-08

## Status

Pending.

## Context

Our users need an easier way to write alerts, they currently have no
easy way to test queries before writing alerts. Our Prometheus
service requires authentication which locks our user out of it.

## Decision

We will give our users access to Prometheus so they can use its
expression browser to test queries when writing alerts. We will
do this by using IP Whitelisting instead of authentication and
only allowing our office IP addresses.

## Consequences

Anyone in the office can access Prometheus and Alertmanager.
