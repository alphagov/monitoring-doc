# 5. Give users access to Prometheus and Alertmanager

Date: 2018-08-08

## Status

Pending.

## Context

Our users need an easier way to write alerts.  They currently have no
easy way to test queries before writing their alerts.

In principle, they could use Prometheus's expression browser for this,
but our Prometheus service requires basic auth, which locks our users
out of it.

## Decision

We will give our users access to Prometheus so they can use its
expression browser to test queries when writing alerts. We will
do this by using IP whitelisting instead of basic auth and
only allowing our office IP addresses.

We identified a number of different routes that we could have taken to
allow our users to access Prometheus.  One possible route that we
considered was using Oauth2 authentication. This would enable users to
authenticate themselves to the platform with their Google account.

We did not choose to go with this option this time for expediency.
The idea behind this was to try to deliver the fastest value as
possible to the user. This method enables us to learn more about the user's
usage pattern. We do intend to add authentication but this will be done at
a later date.

## Consequences

Anyone in the office can access Prometheus and Alertmanager. This means that
they can use expression browser in order to dynamically test and create queries
with fast feedback loop.

With IP whitelisting, we are not able to track our users.
